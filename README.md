# Embodied AI Workshop Website

This repository contains the code that runs the Embodied AI Workshop's website,
[embodied-ai.org](https://embodied-ai.org/). The TL;DR: is that if you push
changes to the main branch on Github, it will trigger a Github action that
will evaluate the changes and then push them live if the website builds.

Development of the website can be run locally via `yarn run develop` which
will stand up a server displaying a website at http://localhost:8000 . Edits
made locally will show up there, so you can test your work.

**NOTE: The Embodied AI Website is archival.** We host our own papers on our website
and we also have pointers to past videos and talks. _Website updates should add new
content, not break previous years' content or 'clean things up' because they are
'out of date'._ We want what we have and are hosting to remain accessible going forward.

### Quick Updates and Troubleshooting

- **Updating Organizer Info**: Organizer info is stored in
  [gatsby-config.js](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/blob/main/gatsby-config.js),
  where the imageId's correspond to those found in
  [static/images/organizers](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/tree/main/static/images/organizers). You may need to restart your local server to pick up the changes.

- **Images Don't Seem to Upload**: Make sure you added them to
  [static](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/tree/main/static)
  and not the auto-generated `public` directory.

- **Website Build Runs Out of Memory**: Try `export NODE_OPTIONS=--max-old-space-size=8192` before
  running `yarn run develop`.

## Structure of the Embodied AI Website

### External Structure

The root of [embodied-ai.org](https://embodied-ai.org/) has the following structure:

- [index.html](https://embodied-ai.org/index.html) automatically redirects to the current year
  (but can be overridden to point to the previous year when prototyping a new year's page.)
- _cvprYYYY/_ points to various years of the workshop:
  - [cvpr2020/](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2020/): Embodied AI Workshop
  - [cvpr2021/](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2021/): Embodied AI #2
  - [cvpr2022/](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2022/): Embodied AI #3
  - [cvpr2023/](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2023/): Embodied AI #4
  - [cvpr2024/](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/): Embodied AI #5 (currently live)
  - [cvpr2025/](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2025/): Embodied AI #6 (in development)

Each year is shown as a single page with all the information about the workshop on it.

Individual pages have a top navigation banner with a dropdown for past years of the workshop on the
upper left, the current year's banner in the middle, and current challenges dropdown on the right.
The banner generally displays the logos of the participating organizations (the affiliations of
the organizers, scientific advisors, challenge organizers, and any sponsors).

Each year's page is broken down into the following:

- [Attending](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#overview): Not live until near the conference,
  this page gives details on the room and ideally a picture.
- [Overview](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#overview): Describes the workshop in detail,
  based on the themes established in this year's proposal.
- [Timeline](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#timeline): Describes the important dates of the
  workshop such as paper submissions, challenge deadlines and the workshop date. Has a "dot"
  which moves down the schedule as it is updated.
- [Workshop Schedule](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#workshop-schedule): The detailed workshop
  schedule (ideally updated with room numbers once they are known).
- [Sponsor Events](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#sponsor-events): A list of sponsor events,
  if any are held this year.
- [Challenges](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#challenges): A table of challenges that are
  running this year.
- [Call for Papers](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#call-for-papers): Details on our call
  for papers, and the place the papers go when accepted.
- [Sponsors](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#sponsors): List of the sponsor organizations.
  These include companies paying some kind of money, e.g., for challenge awards.
- [Organizers](https://embodied-ai.org/cvpr2024/#organizers): List of the lead organizers (called
  out into their own section so the lead organizers can use this as evidence of participation
  to their organizations), other organizers, challenge organizers, and scientific advisors.

### Data Structure

There are several locations where data needs to be updated:

- [gatsby_browser.js](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/blob/main/gatsby-browser.js):
  Controls the year redirect; also update [src/pages/index.tsx](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/blob/main/src/pages/index.tsx).
- [gatsby_config.js](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/blob/main/gatsby-config.js):
  Defines the table of each year's organizers, challenge organizers, and scientific advisors.
- [src/pages/cvprYYYY](https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org/tree/main/src/pages):
  Each year defines its own:
  - **Challenge Page Map:** List of challenges in the dropdown up top.
  - **Challenge Data Table:** List of challenges in the dropdown up top.
  - **Accepted Paper List:** List of accepted papers and abstracts.
  - **Query Table of Images:** A list of image paths for this year's website.

## Development of the Embodied AI Website

The website is developed using Gatsby and relies on React, TypeScript, SCSS, and GraphQL, among other things. It's then statically transformed and optimized into HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (on the `generated-static-pages` branch), which ultimately gets displayed to the user.

To develop locally:

### 0. Consider installing a package manager:

While the website manages its own dependencies with `npm` and `yarn` it does load roughly 1000
packages, so it can be useful to wrap all your work in something like a `conda` environment.
This is not strictly required, however.

### 1. Install [Node.js](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm).

Follow the instructions at the above link.
The installation can be confirmed by typing the following into the command line:

```
npm -v
```

into a command line.

### 2. Install [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)

This makes it easy to install gatsby dependencies (in my experience, over using NPM directly).
The installation can be confirmed by typing the following into the command line:

```
yarn --version
```

### 3. Clone the repo

Get a local copy of the repo and `cd` into it.

```
git clone https://github.com/embodied-ai-workshop/embodied-ai.org.git
cd embodied-ai-website/
```

### 4. Install other dependencies

These include things like scss, TypeScript, and so on, and should be done via `yarn`:

```
yarn install
```

### 5. Check out a development branch

Typically we use a development branch to avoid direct pushes to main:

```
git checkout cvpr2025
```

or `git checkout -b your_branch_name`.

### 6. Build the website locally

Invoke gatsby from the root of the directory to build locally:

```
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider # Needed for newer versions of node
yarn run develop
```

This should then create a local server which shows the live website at http://localhost:8000/.

### 7. Push changes to Github

Now commit your changes and push them remote:

```
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message."
git push
```

### 7. Merge into Head

From the Github page you should see that there are recent changes in your branch.

- Open a pull request to merge them into main.
- Once merged, monitor the github actions to see that they are merged and pushed live
- Verify the live website.

You may need to merge some changes back into your branch if you want to keep using it.

### 8. Update your local repo.

Make sure you are up to date:

```
git pull
```
